## Synopsis

Data science can be as much an art as .. well, a science. Understanding how different analyses work, what they can do and what their limitations are allows you to use them effectively; choosing the right types of analysis can be quite tricky however. To showcase the my understanding of scripting and data science, I wrote a program to to analyze the data provided to generate some interesting observations on GDP, energy use and population mechanics of countries.

As an added touch, the script produces charts using the pandas.py library to better grasp the meaning of these findings.
